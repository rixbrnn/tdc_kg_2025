# Converter Step (RDB → RDF)

## Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

## Run Mapping script
```bash
npm start
```

Output will be located in:
`../rdf/output.trig`

## Run Tests
```bash
npm test
```
- Passing tests confirm implemented mappings are correct.
- Failing tests indicate TODOs in `src/mapping_rdf_todo.js` that need completion.

## TODO
Fix the TODOs located in mapping.js
