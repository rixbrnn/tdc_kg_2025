# Q2 (TODO)
# If a customer buys track "The Trooper",
# what other tracks are most often bought in the same invoices?
#
# Goal:
#   Return tracks that frequently appear on the same invoices
#   as "The Trooper", with a co-purchase count, ordered by that count.
#
# Assumptions:
#   - :Track :name ?trackName
#   - :Invoice :hasLine :InvoiceLine
#   - :InvoiceLine :lineTrack :Track
#
# Hints:
#   1) Bind the target track:
#        ?trackX a :Track ;
#                :name "The Trooper" .
#
#   2) Find invoices that have both:
#        - a line for the target track
#        - another line for a different track
#
#      Something like:
#        ?inv :hasLine ?line1, ?line2 .
#        ?line1 :lineTrack ?trackX .
#        ?line2 :lineTrack ?otherTrack .
#
#   3) Exclude the original track:
#        FILTER(?otherTrack != ?trackX)
#
#   4) Group by ?otherTrack (and its name) and COUNT(*) as co-purchase frequency.
#
#   5) Order by DESC(co-purchase count) and LIMIT 10.
