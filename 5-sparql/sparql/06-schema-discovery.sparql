# Q: What properties and relationships does a Track entity have?
#
# Purpose: ⭐⭐⭐ IMPOSSIBLE IN SQL ⭐⭐⭐ - Dynamic schema exploration
# Complexity: ⭐ (1/5) - Trivial in SPARQL!
# Expected Result: All properties of Track/1 with their values
#
# Demonstrates: SPARQL's schema flexibility - SQL can't do this!
# This is PURE GRAPH MAGIC

SELECT DISTINCT ?property ?value
WHERE {
  :Track/1 ?property ?value .
}
ORDER BY ?property
LIMIT 100

# Example output:
# ?property              | ?value
# ----------------------|---------------------------
# rdf:type              | :Track
# :trackName            | "For Those About To Rock"
# :hasAlbum             | :Album/1
# :hasGenre             | :Genre/1
# :milliseconds         | 343719
# :bytes                | 11170334
# :unitPrice            | 0.99
# :hasMediaType         | :MediaType/1
# :composer             | "Angus Young, Malcolm Young..."

# Want to explore further? Try these variations:

# 1. Find all properties of ANY track:
# SELECT DISTINCT ?property WHERE {
#   ?track a :Track .
#   ?track ?property ?value .
# }

# 2. Find all outgoing relationships (exclude literals):
# SELECT DISTINCT ?property ?relatedEntity WHERE {
#   :Track/1 ?property ?relatedEntity .
#   FILTER(isIRI(?relatedEntity))
# }

# 3. Find all incoming relationships (who references this track):
# SELECT DISTINCT ?source ?property WHERE {
#   ?source ?property :Track/1 .
# }

# Notes for Presentation:
# ✓ ONE LINE: ?entity ?property ?value
# ✓ Discovers schema dynamically
# ✓ No need to know table structure in advance
# ✓ Works for ANY entity in the graph
# ✗ SQL equivalent: IMPOSSIBLE! Would need information_schema queries
#
# SQL limitations:
# - Must query information_schema (meta-database)
# - Can't discover relationships dynamically
# - Requires knowing table names beforehand
# - Foreign keys don't tell you semantic meaning
#
# ⭐⭐⭐ THIS IS SPARQL-ONLY MAGIC! ⭐⭐⭐
#
# Real-world use cases:
# - Data exploration (new dataset? Just query it!)
# - Schema evolution (add properties without ALTER TABLE)
# - Data integration (merge heterogeneous data sources)
# - API discovery (what can I query about this entity?)
# - Dynamic UIs (build forms based on available properties)
#
# This is WHY knowledge graphs are called "self-describing":
# The data includes its own schema!
#
# Challenge to audience: "Try doing this in SQL!"
# (Spoiler: You can't in any meaningful way)
