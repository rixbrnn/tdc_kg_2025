# Q: What properties and relationships does a Track entity have?

SELECT DISTINCT ?property ?value
WHERE {
  :Track/1 ?property ?value .
}
ORDER BY ?property
LIMIT 100

# Want to explore further? Try these variations:

# 1. Find all properties of ANY track:
SELECT DISTINCT ?property WHERE {
  ?track a :Track .
  ?track ?property ?value .
}

# 2. Find all outgoing relationships (exclude literals):
SELECT DISTINCT ?property ?relatedEntity WHERE {
  :Track/1 ?property ?relatedEntity .
  FILTER(isIRI(?relatedEntity))
}

# 3. Find all incoming relationships (who references this track):
SELECT DISTINCT ?source ?property WHERE {
  ?source ?property :Track/1 .
}
